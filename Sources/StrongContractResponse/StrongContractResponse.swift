/// **What is it**: 
///     `Request` is a type intended to be shared on both client and server side to create strong contracts
///
/// **Problem `Request` solves**:
///     Instead of creating a path on the server side, converting types back and forth with `JSON`, creating swagger documents,
///     Then meetings with server side and client side devs to "sync" up, and errors where incorrect payloads are sent to
///     to the server, and client side devs are unsure exactly what values are required by the server side, and not sure what to
///     expect as a response.
///
/// **Set up**:
///     - Import `StrongContractClient` into both the client side app and the server side project.
///
/// **How to use**:
///     1. Create an instance of `Request` assigning the type of the payload you want to send from client to server `Payload` and
///     the type you intend for the server to respond back with `Response`.  Suppose we call our instance of request: `register`
///     2. Make a call to `task` on the client side with your instance: `Request.register.task(` The method will know what payload
///     and response types thanks to the Swift Compiler's Generic type inference.
///     3. Make a call to `registerHandler` on the server side with your instance: `Request.register.registerHandler(`
///     The method will know what payload and response types thanks to the Swift Compiler's Generic type inference.
///
/// **How to modify**:
///     *Change to the payload the client sends and the server side receives*:  Simply make a change to the `Payload` type
///     assigned to your request. merge the changes, create a release, then both client and server update packages.
///     *Change to the response the server sends and the client side receives*:  Simply make a change to the `Response` type
///     assigned to your request, merge the changes, create a release, then both client and server update packages.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - payload: Payload is the type your request instance sends to the server side.  If you don't need to send anything then
///   you can use the `Empty` type.  That way the corresponding `task` and `registerHandler` can omit the payload.
///   - response: The `Response` type is the type that the server returns to the client.
